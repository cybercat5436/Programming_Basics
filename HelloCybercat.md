The best way to familiarize yourself with WPILib is to simulate the robot code on your own computer.  
As an introductory challenge, complete this "Hello World" exercise:

1) After installing WPILib, create a new project by following [these instructions](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-4/creating-test-drivetrain-program-cpp-java-python.html)

  * When creating, make the following selections
  - Project Type --> Template
  - Language --> Java
  - Project Base --> Command

  * Team Number --> 5436

  *  Check the box for "Enable Desktop Support"

2)  Add code into the RobotContainer Constructor to print "Hello CyberCat"
  * execute the code by going to the Command Palette (ctrl + shift + P) and selecting "WPILib: Simulate Robot Code"
  *  Select "Sim GUI" when prompted and click OK
  * When the code executes, another window (Sim GUI) will pop up.  Ignore that and navigate back to VSCode.  In the Terminal window at the bottom of screen, scroll to the top of the output and find your print statement (see attached example output).
